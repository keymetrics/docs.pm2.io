# Ecosystem file reference

The purpose of the ecosystem file is to gather all options and environment variables for all your applications.

It is a javascript file which exports an object with all the configuration options.

The object has two properties:
- apps, an array that contains the configuration for each process
- deploy, an object that contains the configuration for the deployments

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{}, {}],
  deploy: {}
}
```

## Apps options

The apps property is an array of object where each object contains the configuration for each process.

## Deploy options

The deploy property is an object where each of its properties is an object which defines a deployment environment.

The structure is the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{}, {}],
  deploy: {
    production: {},
    staging: {},
    development: {}
  }
}
```

The deployment environment object can have the following properties:

Entry name|Description|Type|Default
